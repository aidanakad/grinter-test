                        US National Mini Golf Team member Gary Hester (+550 field) won the inaugural World
                        Putting League Championship at Hawaiian Rumble Minigolf in Myrtle Beach, S.C. after
                        shooting a final round 31 for 5 under par to defeat Matt McCaslin (33, 3 under par; +190
                        pre-tournament to win) and take home the $5,000 championship purse.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Hester finished the Day 1 qualifying rounds by shooting 32 (-4) and 31 (-5),
                        respectively, to combine for 9 under par and the No. 2 seed heading into the Day 2 match
                        play bracket. After Day 1, Hesterâ€™s odds to win moved to +420.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Hester defeated Rick Alessi with a 35 (-1) in the quarterfinals before squeaking by Joey
                        Graybeal in the semifinals by one stroke, 32 (-4) to 33 (-3). Graybeal entered the Day 2
                        quarterfinals as the top seed (-350 to win after Day 1) after pacing the field with a
                        combined -9 in the two qualifying rounds.
